    - Mostly implent car_grid_search algorithm
    - Use tree to store states as search progresses
    - currently picking next-state from OPEN randomly

5/22
    - ignore car when out of bounds

6/4
    - Try a few cost functions
        -- Euclidean seems to work the fastest, but paths aren't very nice
    - return controls when path is found and plot controlled vehicle

6/7
    - Find and fix a very significant bug:
      -- PropogateVehicle only works for small deltaT values. All propogations should be the same length
      -- PropogateVehicle wraps the propogation code to ensure dt is very small. 
    - Fix the search-grid 'found' method...instead of using euclidian cost function

    - Now that the search-grid, and propogation tree are are actually working, lets fix the cost function!!!
        
6/8
    - Tried introducing gif-recording. almost works, but plotting gets slowed down too much. needs to be fixed

6/12
    - collision checking with trailers + map
    - Cleaned up rest of repo and moved around files
    - Create new maps to test robot
    - Create 'example' runner and examples to run

6/15
    - Get RRT plugged in and almost working... still need to properly do 'end' condition & return controls
    - Get BiRRT plugged in as well...this will probably be useful/necessary.

6/17
    - Properly return & run controls from birrt

6/18
    - developing examples & testing framework
        -- Need to be able to run same map/carconfig with different planners. 
        -- Need to be able to save controls and rerun just the controls
    - sooo many new examples!!
    - save any new solutions into case file
    - file to just display solution

6/25
    - GIF Recording!
